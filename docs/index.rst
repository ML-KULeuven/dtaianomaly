Welcome to the documentation of dtaianomaly!
============================================

``dtaianomaly`` is an easy-to-use Python package for time series anomaly detection. Its main
goal is to offer a simple interface to detect anomalies in time series data using
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ``dtaianomaly`` provides a benchmark framework to
quantitatively evaluate time series anomaly detection methods on a large repository of
time series.

The source is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/dtaianomaly>`_.
